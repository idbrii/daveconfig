# 2004.04.18 -- keith@penguingurus.com - Added gksudo usage to provide popup
#               password window if sudo has expired.  Line only echos got
#               root to std output.  But gksudo updates your sudo access
#               privs, so running nautilus with sudo will succeed
#               without asking for a password.

# 26 Sep 2009 -- pydave - added full paths to ensure we know what's being executed
