  JoyToKey change history  
---------------------------

Ver 5.2.1
* Bug fix: garbled characters for allow keys


Ver 5.2.0
* Support the combination of keyboard and mouse click
  Ex) SHIFT+Click, CTRL+Click

  In order to specify a mouse click in keyboard assignment window,
  please right-click the entry box.

* Bug fix: minor bug fix for 5.1.2


Ver 5.1.2
* Bug fix: SHIFT + arrow keys were not properly processed.


Ver 5.1.1
* Mouse cursor emulation with analog sticks is further improved.


Ver 5.1.0
* Mouse cursor emulation is now much smoother with analog sticks,
  by using a continuous acceleration without a threshold.

* In case analog stick input has been wrong, axis mapping can be
  manually specified.
  (Menu: "Preferences" -> "Configure joysticks")

* In case you have multiple joysticks and want to always use one
  of them as "Joystick 2" (or any other joystick number), you can
  define a priority/preferred number for each device.
  (Menu: "Preferences" -> "Configure joysticks")

* Miscellaneous bug fixes.


Ver 5.0.3
* (Improvement) Re-detect joysticks after resuming from sleep.


Ver 5.0.2
* Bug fix: Preference "Highlight buttons when JoyToKey is active" was not
  properly saved.


Ver 5.0.1
* Added a menu "Help -> Overview"
* Added a button "Edit button assignment"
* Minor bug fixes


Ver 5.0
* Support for different key assignments based on analog stick input level.

* Support for different key assignments based on button hold duration.

* Support for rotating key assignments.  For example, whenever the same
  button is pressed, its key assignment can rotate like 
  "A -> B -> A -> B -> A ..."

* Enhanced auto-repeat key functionality.
  The following auto-repeat definitions are newly possible:
  - "1.5 repeats per second"
  - "one repeat per 123.4 seconds"
  - "auto-repeat only after 500 milli-seconds"

* When the main window of JoyToKey is activated and joystick buttons are
  pressed, those buttons will be highlighted in the main window so that
  you can easily see which button corresponds to which row in the config.
  (You can change it back to the old behaviour from menu setting)

* When the window is minimized, icon will be kept in the taskbar by default.
  If you prefer the old behavoir and want to hide it from taskbar, you can
  change it back to the old behavior from settings menu.

* Added a comment field for each button definition.
  For example, you can record a memo like "This button is used for Jump".

* Support for copying joystick configration from one to another.
  Right-click "Joystick 1" header in the main menu, to open a popup menu.

* Support for at maximum 4 key assignments for each button.

* Various small bug fixes


Ver 4.6
* You can choose the default behavior when the target application switches 
  to non-associated appliation.

* When you temporarily switch to the virtual joystick configuration while 
  some button is being pressed, the pressed state will be kept without 
  release event if its original key config and the new key config are the
  same.  (e.g. if the arrow key is assigned for both the original joystick1 
  config and the virtual joystick3 config, then switching between joystick1 
  and joystick3 won't trigger unnecessary release event)


From ver 3.x to ver4.5.x
* It became a shareware soft

* Support for associating config files with applications
  It can automatically switch active configuration file based on running 
applications.

* Support dynamic acceleration of mouse cursor movement
  If you use mouse cursor emulation with analog stick, the speed 
sensitivity can be accelerated at certain threshold.

* Support 4-way and 8-way assignment for POV control

* Auto repeat functionality, ranging from very slow repeat (1 time per 
15 minutes) up to 60 times per second (with 2x processing mode)

* Support for toggle button
  e.g. use it for drag&drop with mouse emulation, or for truly automated 
repeat of keys even when you are away from PC.

* Window size became re-sizable

* Open / Close main window by left-clicking task tray icon 
  (right-click to open popup menu)

* JoyToKey can be started even when joystick is not connected
  And it will automatically detect the newly connected joystick.
  (NOTE: it only works the first joystick.  If you connect the second one
   or more, please press "detect" button manually from preferences panel)

* Several additions in the menu such as
  - copy configuration file
  - open game controller setting from control panel
  - suspend / resume temporalily
  - 2x processing mode (if you want to minimize the input latency, sacrificing extra CPU load)
  - generate debug log


Ver3.x highlights
* Under Windows 2000 or later (including XP), JoyToKey now supports
  some applications using DirectInput.

* Choosing L-Shift, R-Shift, L-Ctrl, ... from the list, you can make
  a distinction between left and right keys.
  (Be careful to select L-Shift or R-Shift or (normal) Shift!
   You have to choose the correct one for the application!)

* Support for POV switches.

* Support for "Switch to the other configuration file" function.

* The configuration file can be easily selected and switched to
  at task tray menu, without opening and activating JoyToKey window.

* The firstly activated configuration file can now be specified
  by command line option at start up time.

* Analog stick can be configured in detail by modifying JoyToKey.ini
  file directly:

  "AnalogDeadZone"  (ranges 0 to 10000: default 1000)
    The center area where subtle input from analog stick is ignored.

  "AnalogSaturation"  (ranges 0 to 10000: default 10000)
    The surrounding area from which additional inputs are saturated.
