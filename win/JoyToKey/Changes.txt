---------------------------
  JoyToKey change history
---------------------------

Ver 5.7.1
* Support "Numpad Enter" key assignment via right-click menu.

* Support up to 4 POV inputs.

* Enhanced the right-click menu on the joystick tab and on the button list
  such that the selected configuration can be copied-to or pasted-from
  a clipboard.

* Enhanced device configuration to support axis mapping for all 8 axes.


Ver 5.7
* Support for an absolute mouse movement (a.k.a. spring mode)
  Mouse cursor can be positioned at a configured center location and can
  be moved within a specified range with an analog input stick. This can
  be useful for an application like a flight simulator easier.

  A regular button can be also used like a mouse shortcut by jumping the
  mouse cursor to a preconfigured position, followed by a mouse click.

* Exposed hidden parameter "AnalogDeadZone" (which is used for DirectInput
  setup) in "Settings -> Configure Joysticks". If you want to minimize the
  input threshold for your device, please try setting it to zero. If you
  need a different threshold for Stick1 and Stick2, you can continue to do
  so in "Options" tab for each profile.

* Enhanced SHIFT key (virtual joystick) function to support delayed switch.
  Combined with a "Button Number Mapping" feature, for example, one button
  can be assigned for both a regular key input (for a short press) as well
  as for a SHIFT function (for a long press).

* Enhanced "Switch depending on how long the button is pressed" in Keyboard2.
  In case the event emulation is not recognized reliably when you press
  the button too quickly, JoyToKey can now hold it for a minimum duration.
  (default 20 msec)

* Other minor bug fixes


Ver 5.6
* Enhanced "Keyboard 2" functionality to support the followings
  - support 4 keys per definition
  - support the rotation of 4 input definitions
  - support auto repeat and toggle configuration

* Upgraded DirectX library version from 7 to 8.


Ver 5.5.x
* bug fixes


Ver 5.5
* Support "Button Alias (Number Mapping)"

  Example Usage1:
    Swap button numbers if the connected joystick has a different button
    layout from your favorite one.

  Example Usage2:
    Associate Button21 with Button1 so that both functions are triggered
    when Button1 is pressed.

  Example Usage3:
    It is also possible to configure some button (e.g. Button22) to be
    triggered when both Button5 and Button6 are pressed simultaneously.

* If some buttons are pressed when profile is changed or SHIFT function
  is triggered, those button press are likely to trigger both old and new
  assignments right before/after the switch.

  It is now possible to define certain duration (e.g. 100 msec) to ignore
  those inputs right after the switch (from preference menu)

* When both mouse cursor movement and mouse click are assigned to a button,
  click&hold will be processed before cursor movement.

* Improved the reliability after resuming from PC sleep.

* Preferences were moved from menu items to a separate window.

* Added an ability to specify the number of buttons to configure.
  (by default 16 buttons, MAX 32 buttons)

* Changed the user interface font to Calibri

* Configuration files are now saved in Unicode format (UTF8+BOM).
  This may fix garbled character issues for the use of non-default
  language.


Ver 5.4.2
* Fixed garbled characters for some non-Japanese PC and keyboard.

* (only for advanced users)
  Support specifying "JoyToKey.ini" file path via registry.
  If you have any reason why you need to forcibly specify "JoyToKey.ini"
  file path (e.g. you're using some launcher like Hyperlaunch), you can
  do so via registry editor.
  1. Run "regedit" program
  2. Create a key "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JoyToKey"
  3. Create a string value "IniFilePath=c:\whateverpath\JoyToKey.ini"


Ver 5.4.1
* Support various file formats (such as mp3) for sound notifications.


Ver 5.4
* Added an ability to play sound or show tasktray balloon when the
  selected profile is changed.

  - Tasktray balloon can be enabled from "Preferences" menu.

  - Sound notification can be configured for each profile in "Options"
    tab. (currently, only WAV files are supported)

  For example, sound notification could be useful for visually impaired
  users, while they step through different profiles to help them to pick
  the right one.

* The size of profile files is made smaller by eliminating empty lines.

* In case "JoyToKey.ini" file or its directory is not write-able,
  JoyToKey will try to make them write-able.


Ver 5.3.1
* Homepage URL was changed to http://joytokey.net/


Ver 5.3.0
* Support delayed input for a special function to switch profiles.
  If you want to keep JoyToKey running while you're playing a game
  which has a native joystick support, the followings may be useful.
  - Temporarily switch to a profile, which is basically empty
  - But it has one button assigned for switching back to the
    original profile after being pressed for X seconds.

* Control the behaviour when JoyToKey window is active from menu
  "Preferences" ->
    "Don't emulate keyboard input when JoyToKey window is active"
  (by default true)


Ver 5.2.3
* Support emulation for 4th and 5th mouse button.
  They could be useful if you're using mouse gestures with joysticks.

* Turbo mode was enhanced to support up to x16 processing speed.
  However, this is experimental and should not be used for regular use
  as it's very CPU intensive and is likely to slow down the PC.


Ver 5.2.2
* Support for loading configuration files from a common AppData folder
  when it exists. (e.g. C:\ProgramData\JoyToKey)

* Added a new menu "Open file folder in Explorer"


Ver 5.2.1
* Bug fix: garbled characters for allow keys


Ver 5.2.0
* Support the combination of keyboard and mouse click
  Ex) SHIFT+Click, CTRL+Click

  In order to specify a mouse click in keyboard assignment window,
  please right-click the entry box.

* Bug fix: minor bug fix for 5.1.2


Ver 5.1.2
* Bug fix: SHIFT + arrow keys were not properly processed.


Ver 5.1.1
* Mouse cursor emulation with analog sticks is further improved.


Ver 5.1.0
* Mouse cursor emulation is now much smoother with analog sticks,
  by using a continuous acceleration without a threshold.

* In case analog stick input has been wrong, axis mapping can be
  manually specified.
  (Menu: "Preferences" -> "Configure joysticks")

* In case you have multiple joysticks and want to always use one
  of them as "Joystick 2" (or any other joystick number), you can
  define a priority/preferred number for each device.
  (Menu: "Preferences" -> "Configure joysticks")

* Miscellaneous bug fixes.


Ver 5.0.3
* (Improvement) Re-detect joysticks after resuming from sleep.


Ver 5.0.2
* Bug fix: Preference "Highlight buttons when JoyToKey is active" was not
  properly saved.


Ver 5.0.1
* Added a menu "Help -> Overview"
* Added a button "Edit button assignment"
* Minor bug fixes


Ver 5.0
* Support for different key assignments based on analog stick input level.

* Support for different key assignments based on button hold duration.

* Support for rotating key assignments.  For example, whenever the same
  button is pressed, its key assignment can rotate like 
  "A -> B -> A -> B -> A ..."

* Enhanced auto-repeat key functionality.
  The following auto-repeat definitions are newly possible:
  - "1.5 repeats per second"
  - "one repeat per 123.4 seconds"
  - "auto-repeat only after 500 milli-seconds"

* When the main window of JoyToKey is activated and joystick buttons are
  pressed, those buttons will be highlighted in the main window so that
  you can easily see which button corresponds to which row in the config.
  (You can change it back to the old behaviour from menu setting)

* When the window is minimized, icon will be kept in the taskbar by default.
  If you prefer the old behavoir and want to hide it from taskbar, you can
  change it back to the old behavior from settings menu.

* Added a comment field for each button definition.
  For example, you can record a memo like "This button is used for Jump".

* Support for copying joystick configration from one to another.
  Right-click "Joystick 1" header in the main menu, to open a popup menu.

* Support for at maximum 4 key assignments for each button.

* Various small bug fixes


Ver 4.6
* You can choose the default behavior when the target application switches 
  to non-associated appliation.

* When you temporarily switch to the virtual joystick configuration while 
  some button is being pressed, the pressed state will be kept without 
  release event if its original key config and the new key config are the
  same.  (e.g. if the arrow key is assigned for both the original joystick1 
  config and the virtual joystick3 config, then switching between joystick1 
  and joystick3 won't trigger unnecessary release event)


From ver 3.x to ver4.5.x
* It became a shareware soft

* Support for associating config files with applications
  It can automatically switch active configuration file based on running 
applications.

* Support dynamic acceleration of mouse cursor movement
  If you use mouse cursor emulation with analog stick, the speed 
sensitivity can be accelerated at certain threshold.

* Support 4-way and 8-way assignment for POV control

* Auto repeat functionality, ranging from very slow repeat (1 time per 
15 minutes) up to 60 times per second (with 2x processing mode)

* Support for toggle button
  e.g. use it for drag&drop with mouse emulation, or for truly automated 
repeat of keys even when you are away from PC.

* Window size became re-sizable

* Open / Close main window by left-clicking task tray icon 
  (right-click to open popup menu)

* JoyToKey can be started even when joystick is not connected
  And it will automatically detect the newly connected joystick.
  (NOTE: it only works the first joystick.  If you connect the second one
   or more, please press "detect" button manually from preferences panel)

* Several additions in the menu such as
  - copy configuration file
  - open game controller setting from control panel
  - suspend / resume temporalily
  - 2x processing mode (if you want to minimize the input latency, sacrificing extra CPU load)
  - generate debug log


Ver3.x highlights
* Under Windows 2000 or later (including XP), JoyToKey now supports
  some applications using DirectInput.

* Choosing L-Shift, R-Shift, L-Ctrl, ... from the list, you can make
  a distinction between left and right keys.
  (Be careful to select L-Shift or R-Shift or (normal) Shift!
   You have to choose the correct one for the application!)

* Support for POV switches.

* Support for "Switch to the other configuration file" function.

* The configuration file can be easily selected and switched to
  at task tray menu, without opening and activating JoyToKey window.

* The firstly activated configuration file can now be specified
  by command line option at start up time.

* Analog stick can be configured in detail by modifying JoyToKey.ini
  file directly:

  "AnalogDeadZone"  (ranges 0 to 10000: default 1000)
    The center area where subtle input from analog stick is ignored.

  "AnalogSaturation"  (ranges 0 to 10000: default 10000)
    The surrounding area from which additional inputs are saturated.
