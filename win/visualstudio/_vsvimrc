"""" Key Mappings

" CTRL-U in insert mode deletes a lot.  Use CTRL-G u to first break undo,
" so that you can undo CTRL-U after inserting a line break.
" This doesn't work in VsVim - it inserts a ^G character.
"inoremap <C-U> <C-G>u<C-U>


" Generic Header comments (requires formatoptions+=r)
"  Uses vim's commentstring to figure out the local comment character
"nmap <Leader>hc ggO<C-r>=&commentstring<CR><Esc>0/%s<CR>2cl<CR> @file	<C-r>%<CR>@module	<C-r>=expand('%:p:h:t')<CR><CR><CR>@author	_me<CR>@brief	<CR><CR>Copyright (c) <C-R>=strftime("%Y")<CR> _company All Rights Reserved.<CR><Esc>3kA

" Magic global search (see smagic)
nmap gs :%sm/
xmap gs :sm/


" Windows keys
nmap <C-s> :w<CR>
" change increment to allow select all
nnoremap <C-x><C-s> <C-a>
nnoremap <C-x><C-x> <C-x>
" select all
nnoremap <C-a> 1GVG
" Windows clipboard
xmap <C-c> "+y
nnoremap <C-v> "+p

" C-L for esc
inoremap <C-L> <Esc>:nohl<CR><C-L>
nnoremap <C-L> :nohl<CR><C-L>

" I've started using Shift-Insert to paste too (especially in insert)
inoremap <S-Insert> <C-r>+
cnoremap <S-Insert> <C-r>+

" Paste last yanked item
noremap <Leader>p "0p
noremap <Leader>P "0P

" Make Y work like D and C
nmap Y y$

" Make backspace work in normal
nmap <BS> X

" Move in file
nnoremap <Leader>[ <C-o>
nnoremap <Leader>] <C-i>

" Switch files
"nmap ^ <C-^>
"nmap <A-Left> :bp<CR>
"nmap <A-Right> :bn<CR>

" Ctrl+Shift+PgUp/Dn - Move between files
"nnoremap <C-S-PageDown> :next<CR>
"nnoremap <C-S-PageUp> :prev<CR>
" Ctrl+PgUp/Dn - Move between quickfix marks
"nnoremap <C-PageDown> :cnext<CR>
"nnoremap <C-PageUp> :cprev<CR>
" Alt+PgUp/Dn - Move between location window marks
"nnoremap <A-PageDown> :lnext<CR>
"nnoremap <A-PageUp> :lprev<CR>

""" Extra functionality for some existing commands:

" Q formats paragraphs, instead of entering ex mode
"noremap Q gq

" * and # search for next/previous of selected text when used in visual mode
"xnoremap g* y/<C-R>"<CR>
"xnoremap g# y?<C-R>"<CR>

" <Shift-space> reloads the file
"nnoremap <S-space> :e<CR>

" <space> toggles folds opened and closed
"nnoremap <space> za
"nnoremap <A-space> zA

" <space> in visual mode creates a fold over the marked range
"xnoremap <space> zf
