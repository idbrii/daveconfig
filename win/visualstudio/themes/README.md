These themes require Visual Studio 2017 Color Theme Editor:

	https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.VisualStudio2017ColorThemeEditor

They are based on solarized and SublimeMaterial:

	https://github.com/leddt/visualstudio-colors-solarized
	https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/visualstudio-colors-solarized
	https://github.com/Microsoft/VS-ColorThemes/blob/master/VSColorThemes/Themes/SublimeMaterialDark.xml

They were originally created with 2013 (Davidized) and 2017 Community
(SublimeDavid), so they may be missing newer colours.
