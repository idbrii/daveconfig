These themes require Visual Studio 2017 Color Theme Editor:

	https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.VisualStudio2017ColorThemeEditor

They are based on solarized, SublimeMaterial, and PlainDark:

	https://github.com/leddt/visualstudio-colors-solarized
	https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/visualstudio-colors-solarized
	https://github.com/Microsoft/VS-ColorThemes/blob/master/VSColorThemes/Themes/SublimeMaterialDark.xml
	https://github.com/Microsoft/VS-ColorThemes/blob/master/VSColorThemes/Themes/PlainDark.xml

They were originally created with 2013 (Davidized), 2017 Community
(SublimeDavid), 2017 Pro (PlainDavid) so they may be missing newer colours.

You may need to import into VS, copy the theme, and then select it.

Most important distinction is that the title bar changes colour when active.
